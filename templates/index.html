       	<h2>Sleep</h2>
	<p>Many students sacrifice their sleep without even realising the effects it has on students and their overall performance in school.</p>
	<h3>Why is sleep important.</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Good sleep can decrease mood swings</li>
	<li>Increase productivity </li>
	<li>Increase mental heatlth</li>
	<li>Is essential for a Good memory</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A good rest is important as it allows the brain to reset.</p>
	<h3>Sleep Deprivation</h4>
	<p>Sleep deprivation is very serious and affects many young people.</p>
	<p>Sleep deprivation is "the situation or condition of suffering from a lack of sleep" according to the Oxford Dictionary and can severely affect the mental health of students and how they perform in school</p>
	<h4>The symptoms of Sleep deprivation are as follows:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Daytime drowsiness</li>
	<li>Unable to concentrate</li>	
	<li>Memory problems</li>
	<li>Poor school performance </li>
	<li>Problems with impulse control</li>
       </ul>
	<br></br>
	<h2>Resources of Students</h2>
	<p>While sleep does affect a student's overall performance, there are other overlooked factors, such as the resources available to a student  </p>
	<p>Poverty effects students early on in their learning.There is an evident gap between those who are well off and those who aren't.Especially in school as studies have poven in Ireland,students from impoverished famillies test the lowest in maths and reading. </p
	<p>This is simply because poorer students are less likey to:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Do Grinds classes as they cost money</li>
	<li>Go to the libary</li>
	<li>Spend time studying after school as their famillies are usually very  dependaant on them </li>
	<li>Be attentive in class due to hunger or worrying about family members </li>
	<p></p>
	</ul>
	<h2>Attendance in school</h2>
	<p>School attendance is often disregarded by students but hugely impacts how well students do in school. </p>
	<p>accoring to 'The Irish Examiner': Children in second class in 2023, who would have experienced covid school closures while in junior infants, demonstrated a  higher level of worry and anxiety compared to those who attended second class in 2019.
 </p>
	<p>This shows us clearly that not being in school over a long period of time can affect how students feel about school and studying.</p>
	<p>Other affects of not attending school  are: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>Social Isolation</li>
	<li>Falling behind in grades</li>
	<li>Stress and anxiety</li>
	</ul>
